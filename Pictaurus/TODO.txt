[x] Unpause after waiting more than 2 minutes

[ ] Bug: After moving the pictures folder, pictaurus still tries to load old pictures from a defunct location
[ ] Refactor picture model:
	[ ] Always factor all pictures into a long array with no repeats
		[ ] coallate all pictures into a master array
		[ ] Get the recent pictures list and start filling working array if picture is available, removing from master array as we go
		[ ] Randomly place the remaining pictures
	[ ] Up and down moves in the folder as before, but does not "remember" in the long array.
	[ ] Saving only remembers last 50 pictures or so
[ ] When settings change, clear out recent pictures list
[ ] Pictaurus: Show picture date
[ ] Pictaurus: Option to show text
[ ] Right-Click
	[ ] Copy picture
	[ ] Copy path
	[ ] Post to facebook
[ ] Be able to quickly edit title and add annotations
[ ] Tag people in the picture
[ ] Apply some kind of mark that says this picture has been annotated 
	– be able to exclude these pics from random viewing or have an arrow that takes you to the next non-annotated picture
